set that can be assembled from the arrived clothings?Note : One item cannot be used
in more than one set however some items may be left unused.

A Police Job
There was a robbery last night!
All the mobile phones which were in the shop were numbered in ascending order
from the integer number x
For example, if x = 5 and there were 4 mobile phones in the shop,then the phone
has indices 5,6,7 and 8 and if x = 9 and there were 6 devices the phones had indices
9,10,11,12,13 and 14.
After the heist only n mobile phones remain and the indices, they have m1, m2,
m3....mn.
Find the minimum possible number of mobile phones that have been stolen. The
employees working in the shop neither remember x nor the number of mobile
phones in the store before the heist.

Input Format
The first line contains number of mobile phones after the robbery
The second line contain indices of the mobile phone after the robbery

Constraints
n (1≤n≤1000) (1≤mi≤10^9)

Output Format
Print the minimum number of mobile phones stolen from the shop, if the employees
in the shop neither remember x nor the number of mobile phones in the store before
the heist.
